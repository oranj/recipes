INGREDIENTS
* 1 Sugar or Pie Pumpkin
* 2 Sharp Apples (ex. Granny Smith)
* 3 Eggs beaten
* 2 Handfuls of fresh herbs (I used Rosemary, Parsley, and Thyme)
* 6 Tablespoons (85g) Salted Butter
* 1/3 Cup (50g) Raisins
* 1/3 Cup (50g) Currants
* 1/2 Cup (100g) Sugar
* 1/4 Cup (60ml) Sherry or Sack
* Lard or Vegetable Oil for frying (optional)
* 1 Nine-Inch Pie Crust

METHOD
1. Set the oven to 425°F (220°C) and line a pie dish with your pie dough.
2. Peel the pumpkin, then remove the stem and seeds, and quarter it. Slice each piece into thin slices, about 1/4 inch thick. Repeat this process with the apples.
3. Put 2 tablespoons of the butter into a frying pan and set over medium heat. Note that, depending on the amount of pumpkin you fry, you may require more butter; you can also use lard or vegetable oil. Then mix the herbs into the beaten eggs and dip the pumpkin slices into the egg, coating them lightly. Then place them into the frying pan and fry for 10 minutes, or until the pumpkin is quite soft. Depending on the size of your pumpkin, you may need to do this in several batches. The pumpkin should not be more than 3 layers thick in the pan.
4. While the pumpkin fries, line the bottom of your pie crust with the apples. Once the pumpkin is cooked, place it in a bowl with 2 tablespoons of the butter, along with the raisins, currants, sugar, and the sherry or sack. Mix everything together and pour over the apples, smoothing the top. Bake for 20 minutes at 425°F (220°C), then reduce heat to 375°F (190°C) and bake 40-50 minutes longer, or until the top of the pie is bubbling. Remove from the oven and set a on a wire rack. Scatter the 2 remaining tablespoons of butter on the top of the pie and allow to melt in. Cool completely before slicing.
