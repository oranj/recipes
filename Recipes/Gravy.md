Gravy From Stock
======

## Ingredients
* 4 tablespoons unsalted butter (or use fat from your cooled stock, or vegan butter, for dairy free)
* 3 tablespoons to 4 tablespoons Wondra flour (Cake flour also works reasonably well, if you don’t have Wondra.)
* 1 quart stock, from the recipe above, or some reasonable homemade (and NOT store-bought) alternative.
* 1/4 teaspoon to 1 teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce, or more or less, to taste
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup dry white wine (or 1/3 cup Madeira)
* 1 splash more Cognac (optional, but so, so good)

## Method
1. If you haven't done so already, remove and reserve or discard the fat from the cooled stock, and then heat the stock. (I heat it in the Mason jar used to store the stock.) Keep the stock warm and close by as you do the next step.
2. Cook the butter or turkey fat over medium heat until the butter is melted. Sprinkle on the flour, whisking all the while. It will soon look like a somewhat thick paste.
3. As soon as the paste is thick and golden, slowly pour in the warmed stock, no more than a cup at a time, over medium heat, whisking vigorously the whole time, and cooking for at least 30 seconds between additions of stock. It may look lumpy and thick, but don’t despair. It will smooth itself out as you add the rest of the stock, provided that the stock is warm, you stream it in slowly, and you whisk without stopping. Add the wine—and Cognac, if you want to pull out all the stops—and cook, continuing to whisk, for about 2 minutes.
4. Add the reserved pan drippings and whatever liquid has accumulated. You can also add some of the fat, if you like your gravy quite rich. Then add the Worcestershire sauce, a quarter teaspoon at a time, tasting before adding more. Stir well while cooking over medium-low heat for about a minute. See note below about using the drippings from your roast turkey, which is optional.
5. Check for salt and correct - but don't add much if you will be adding more pan drippings on Thanksgiving. Add freshly ground pepper to taste.
