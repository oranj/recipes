## The wonderful world of Blind Baking (for all single-crust pies)

# Ingredients
* One 9-inch pie crust, crimped and frozen
* Aluminum foil
* 1 1/2 pounds dried beans

# Method:
Preheat your oven to 450ÂºF with the rack on the lowest level. Remove the pie crust from the freezer, tear off a square of aluminum foil that is slightly larger than the pie shell, and gently fit it into the frozen crust. Fill the crust with the dried beans (they should come all the way up to the crimps) and place the pie pan on a baking sheet. Transfer the baking sheet  to the oven and bake for 25 to 27 minutes. Check for doneness by peeling up a piece of foil--The crimps should be light golden brown. Remove the baking sheet ferom the oven and transfer to a cooling rack. After 6 minutes, carefull remove the foil and beans. You did it! You are now ready to fill the pie.
